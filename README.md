# Laptop Power Supply Hardware Troubleshooting and Repair
This repository documents the process of troubleshooting and repairing a laptop power supply issue. The problem was identified as a power clog, which was resolved by disconnecting and reconnecting the internal cord connected to the battery.

<h2> Problem Description: </h2>
The laptop was experiencing power supply issues, which manifested as an inability for my laptop to turn on and charge when connected to the AC power source. The power indicator light would not illuminate, and the laptop would not respond to the power button being pressed.

<h2> Troubleshooting Steps: </h2> 

- Initial Diagnosis: The first step was to rule out issues with the AC adapter and power cord. These components were tested with another device and found to be working correctly, indicating that the problem was within the laptop itself.

- Internal Inspection: The laptop was carefully disassembled to allow access to the internal components. This process requires specific tools and knowledge of laptop assembly, so it should only be undertaken by those with appropriate experience or under the guidance of a professional.

- Identifying the Issue: Upon inspection and internet research it was determined that the issue was a power clog. This can occur when the laptop's power management system becomes overloaded, preventing power from reaching the battery or other components.

<h2> Repair Process: </h2> 

- Disconnecting the Battery: The internal cord connecting the battery to the laptop's power management system was identified and carefully disconnected. This step requires precision to avoid damaging the cord or other nearby components.

- Resetting the Power Management System: With the battery disconnected, the power management system was reset. This clears the power clog and allows power to flow correctly when the battery is reconnected.

- Reconnecting the Battery: The internal cord was then reconnected to the battery, restoring the laptop's power supply.
